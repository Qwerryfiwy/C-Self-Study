Use to store data and information
Use to read an access data any time from hard disc
Access and store content without losing it on program termination

Volatile (RAM):
It only maintain its data while the device is powered
Will hold data temporarily
Non-Volatile(Hard Disc):
It can retain stored information even when not powered.
Long Term storage of data.

C=> Terminated => RAM DATA is Lost
=> We should store it in file.


Types of Files:

Binary Files

File Operation in C:
1.Creating new file
2.Opening a file.
